# casino-poker-bot
A lot of python code which would play Casino Poker 100% correctly, were you able to run it :)

It was my first attempt at botting, which actually worked!

It could CV the cards, make the plays according to the best strategy calculated fast enough for the game to be playable.

Of course, it only played Casino Poker, which probabilistically cannot be won (because of the house edge), but I really tried (there are some randomizers to make stakes random or make sense of them kind of).

There are also classes and functions which allow to calculate best possible strategy for Video Poker, for example.

The algorithm for equity calculations is my own invention, but it turned out I just reinvented the wheel, haha :) For more info on poker equity calculators, see this: https://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/poker-hand-evaluator-roundup/

Still, could be possible to bonus hunt with this. Didn't try it tho. 

Use it as you please.
